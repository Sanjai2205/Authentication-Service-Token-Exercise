# Authentication-Service-Token-Exercise
The purpose of this exercise is to move beyond local/test setups (mock JWTs, in-memory users) and integrate your authorization service (authz_service) with a real-world identity provider. This ensures that authentication and authorization flows in your application work exactly as they would in production.
